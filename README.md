# CapstoneProjectFSFinal

For this project I've used Angular CLI for FrontEnd, SpringBoot for BackEnd  and PostGreSQL for database.

First of all open the Java project, go to application.properties and change my data with yours.

Open the CapstoneProjectFSApplication.java and uncomment the following line: "InserisciDatiIniziali".
Run the CapstoneProjectFSApplication.java and wait until the database is filled. Then comment again the mentioned line and save the project.

Generate a new Angular project and replace all the files, from src to the end, with mine. Open this project and run in powershell console "ng serve".

Finally open your browser and type .../localhost:4200.

Thank you for your kind attention.
